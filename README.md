What is docker? : It's a way to package applications along with their dependencies and requirements, allowing them to be used and accessed from anywhere.
it seems like virtual machine do the same ? : 
why we need virtual machiens? : when we have a large server and we need more servers for diffrent os or servers for db or back end. so that we need to split that server to mini servers useing virtual machiesn 
  that will allow us to have multible machiens.
